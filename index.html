<h1> 
<p> About Me </p>
</h1>

<p> My name is Joel Roble. I am an aspiring web developer and filmmaker who enrolled in SPaCE to
    get a certificate 
    <br> 
    that will help me find a job. I chose the Diploma Program In UI/UX For Web Design and Development because I have 
    <br>
    some experience with coding during high school and because 
    of the lucrative opportunities found in tech-based 
    <br> careers like Web Development.
</p>

<p> My hobbies/interests include reading books, watching films, playing video games, learning history and playing chess.
    <br>
I developed a passion for film because of a group project in Grade 8 English, where I made a short film with my 
<br>
classmates. Despite the challenges we faced during
the project, I managed to transform the footage we captured over 
<br>
the course of 2-3 weeks into a watchable short film with the power of audiovisual editing.
