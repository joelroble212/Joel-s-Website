    <p> Photography </p>
    </h2>

<p style="color:white; font-family:monospace;" > During high school I developed a passion for the visual art of photography. I initially got into
    it as a hobby 
    <br>
    but I started using it for school activities such as events and projects. After switching schools I didn't get the
    <br>
    opportunity 
    to use my skills in an academic/profesional setting
    but I still pursued it as a hobby, mostly when traveling.

<h2 style="color:white; font-family:monospace;"> 
    <p> Reading and Writing </p>
    </h2>

<p style="color:white; font-family:monospace;" > Ever since a young age I excelled in English, often getting high grades and garnering praise
from teachers. I learned much about 
<br>
the mechanics of writing and reading English partly from childhood exposure to English-language books, cartoons, anime,
newspapers, 
<br> and manga/comics. I honed these skills not just through academic activities but also as a hobby; I often wrote horror stories and 
<br> 
comics during my free time.        
</p>

<h2 style="color:white; font-family:monospace;"> 
    <p> Video Recording and Editing </p>
    </h2>

<p style="color:white; font-family:monospace;" > During a major group project in Grade 8 English we were tasked to create 
    a performance of Romeo and Juliet. As leader of the group, 
    <br>
    I chose to make the performance a short film. During the project, I learned/honed
    various skills such as capturing footage effectively, 
    <br>
    editing footage together, and adding sound effects, background music and subtitles. Our teacher gave us a high grade for the project
    <br>
    and the success of the project contributed to my passion for films.

    <h2 style="color:white; font-family:monospace;"> 
        <p> Group Collaboration  </p>
        </h2>
    
    <p style="color:white; font-family:monospace;" > While I prefer solo work to group work, I would say that I have done well in group activities
        during high school. Whether I was the group's 
        <br>
        leader or not, I cooperated with my groupmates to make sure we got a good grade by finding 
        effective ways to utilize the group members' skills
        <br>
        and work around the limitations of the project.
